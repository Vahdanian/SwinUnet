  gradient_clip_val: 1.0  # Gradient clipping for stability
  use_amp: true  # Mixed precision training (faster, larger effective batch size)
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 8  # Accumulate gradients over N batches (reduces memory, effective batch size = batch_size * gradient_accumulation_steps = 8)
  empty_cache: true  # Clear CUDA cache between batches (helps with memory fragmentation)

# Loss function settings - Enhanced combined loss
loss:
  type: "enhanced"  # "dice", "combined", or "enhanced"
  dice_weight: 0.4  # Increased - more focus on Dice
